# Code Challenge 6 - Linked List Insertions

Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods.

## Challenge Summary

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
  - arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

### Unit Tests

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

I added the new methods to the existing Linked Lists class from provious challenge. Also implemented the testing within the existing tests document.
