# Code Challenge 11 - PseudoQueue

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

- Create a new class called pseudo queue.
  - Do not use an existing Queue.
  - Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
  - Internally, utilize 2 `Stack` instances to create and manage the queue

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We worked in pairs to create our whiteboard during class. The first 10 minutes, I navigated while Ethan drove, to create our first four sections including the problem domain, test cases, visualization and algorithm. We switched roles after 10 minutes and I drove while Ethan navigated for writing the code.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
### Class PseudoQueue methods:

- enqueue
  - Arguments: value
  - Inserts a `value` into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue
  - Arguments: none
  - Extracts a `value` from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
